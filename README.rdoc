= RFID localization

This app is made during my competition for a Ph.D. degree.
The subject of a thesis is Development of Methods of Spatial Object Localization based on Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Technology.
The app allows many different things. Examples:
1) process measurement data obtained from RFID tags by several antennas to create tag position estimates in 2D space (using different types of point-based and zone-based algorithms);
2) search for the optimal antenna deployment (such a deployment that minimizes the average tag localization error) using different heuristic optimization algorithms;
3) make different kinds of simulations;
4) do the regression analysis and analyze data (calculate correlations, deviations and so on).
The app was intended for private use only so no comments and tests.
